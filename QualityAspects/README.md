The following software quality aspects directly impact the economic performance of companies, because software increasingly represents core business processes. Understanding these aspects and translating them into practical implementation drives engineering productivity, which in turn affects costs and enables faster adaptation to new requirements, fostering innovation.

## Maintainability & Extensibility

**What it is:**  
The degree to which a system can be efficiently modified to fix defects and add new features, without introducing unintended side effects or breaking existing functionality.

**Why it matters:**  
- Software evolves, requirements shift, bugs appear, and new features are requested. Itâ€™s the nature of software applications.  
- Maintainable code reduces the cost and risk of change, allowing teams to adapt quickly.  
- Extensible design enables future growth, so new functionalities can be integrated with minimal rework.  
- High maintainability fosters engineers' productivity and team morale, since the codebase is easier to understand and improve.  

**Key drivers:**  
- High readability - clear naming, consistent style (sometimes people get too attached and ignore good designs that matter the most), and straightforward logic.  
- Low coupling between components - minimizing interdependencies so changes in one module don't ripple across the system.  
- Strong cohesion within components - grouping related responsibilities together and avoiding "God classes".  
- Good modular boundaries - Defining clear interfaces and separation of concerns.  
- Adhere to SOLID principles - Principles that will guide implementation, aiming for maintainability and extensibility.  
- Comprehensive automated tests - ensuring safe refactoring and evolution.

## Testability

**What is:**  
The degree to which a software system or its components can be effectively and efficiently tested. In practice, it means how easily small units of the application can be tested in isolation, without requiring complex setup or dependencies.

**Why it matters:**  
- Enables fast feedback on code changes, allowing engineers to quickly run and debug small units of functionality.  
- Encourages writing deterministic code, where behavior is consistent and predictable under the same conditions.  
- Improves confidence in changes, since tests act as a safety net during refactoring or feature development.  
- Reduces the cost of defects, as issues are discovered earlier in the development cycle.  

**Key drivers:**  
- Modularity - designing software as independent, loosely coupled components.  
- Inversion of Control (IoC) & Dependency Injection (DI) - making dependencies explicit and replaceable, which facilitates mocking and stubbing.  
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - ensuring each class or function has one well-defined purpose, reducing hidden behaviors that complicate tests.
