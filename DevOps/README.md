# Introduction — The Need for Acceleration

In today’s rapidly changing market, *business as usual* is no longer enough.  
High-performing organizations are defined by their ability to **accelerate** — to sense opportunities quickly, deliver value faster, and adapt continuously to new conditions.

Successful companies no longer rely on rigid structures or long delivery cycles. Instead, they empower **small, cross-functional teams** that work in short iterations, collect real user feedback, and continuously improve products and services that delight customers.

To remain competitive and excel in the market, organizations must accelerate their ability to:

- **Deliver** goods and services that exceed customer expectations.  
- **Engage** with the market to detect and understand customer demand.  
- **Anticipate** compliance and regulatory changes that affect their systems.  
- **Respond** swiftly to potential risks such as security threats or economic disruptions.

At the heart of this acceleration lies **software** — the engine that drives modern business performance.  
The way organizations build, deliver, and operate software has become a direct reflection of how they compete and win in the marketplace.

## The DevOps Movement

The principles and practices that enable this acceleration are embodied in the **DevOps movement**.  
DevOps is not a department, a job title, or a single technology. It is a collection of cultural values, technical practices, and organizational capabilities that help teams deliver high-quality software *quickly, reliably, and safely.*

### Core DevOps Principles

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** integrating and testing code frequently to reduce risk and improve flow.  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** automating the path from code to production to achieve fast, safe releases.  
- **Lean Practices:** eliminating waste, shortening feedback loops, and optimizing the value stream.  
- **Collaborative Culture:** promoting shared ownership, trust, and open communication between teams.

### Capability Categories

Research summarized in *Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps* identifies five key categories of capabilities that drive software delivery performance:

1. **Continuous Delivery**
2. **Architecture**
3. **Product and Process**
4. **Lean Management and Monitoring**
5. **Cultural**

Together, these capabilities form the foundation of high-performing technology organizations.

## Measurement and the Leadership Gap

One of the most common findings from the *State of DevOps* research is that **executives often overestimate** their organization’s DevOps performance compared to those doing the day-to-day work.  
This gap usually stems from a **lack of measurement and visibility** — leaders cannot improve what they cannot see.

Effective DevOps transformations depend on **data-driven insights**.  
By tracking the right metrics — those that reflect *delivery performance* and *organizational health* — leaders can make strategic decisions that drive both speed and stability.

## Focus on Capabilities, Not Maturity

A key lesson from high-performing organizations is to focus on **capabilities**, not **maturity**.  
Traditional maturity models encourage organizations to reach a predefined “end state” and declare themselves *done*.  
In contrast, technology transformations must embrace a **continuous improvement mindset**, one of the core principles of Agile and Lean thinking.

Every team operates within its own unique context, goals, and constraints.  
Therefore, each should evolve along a path that maximizes its impact — continuously improving its capabilities rather than chasing a static notion of maturity.
