# Knowledge Base

Hi there, welcome to my knowledge base repository.  
I created this repo to write down some articles about software engineering topics to serve as a guide for my daily activities, support decision-making, and improve knowledge itself. Writing about what we read is also a powerful way of learning, since reasoning through the material helps reinforce understanding.  

The topics I chose to write about (for now) are all based on books I have read — and some that I’m planning to read. They cover important aspects of engineering responsibilities, such as:  

- 🏗️ System Design  
- 🧩 OOP  
- 🧠 Engineering Thinking and Pragmatism  
- ⚙️ DevOps Culture and Practices  
- ✅ Software Quality  

If you find any topic that interests you and you’d like to collaborate, feel free to create pull requests or raise discussions.  

Thank you for the visit!
