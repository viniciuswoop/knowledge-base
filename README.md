# Knowledge Base

Hi there, welcome to my knowledge base repository.  
I created this repo to write down some articles about software engineering topics to serve as a guide for my daily activities, support decision-making, and improve knowledge itself. Writing about what we read is also a powerful way of learning, since reasoning through the material helps reinforce understanding.  

The topics I chose to write about (for now) are all based on books I have read â€” and some that Iâ€™m planning to read. They cover important aspects of engineering responsibilities, such as:  

- System Design  
- OOP  
- Engineering Thinking and Pragmatism  
- DevOps Culture and Practices  
- [Software Quality Aspects](./QualityAspects/)

If you find any topic that interests you and youâ€™d like to collaborate, feel free to create pull requests or raise discussions.  

Thank you for the visit!
