# Managing Complexity  

Managing complexity is the discipline of organizing software systems in ways that make them easier to understand, modify, and evolve. Complexity is inevitable as systems grow, but uncontrolled complexity leads to fragile designs, slower development, and higher costs. It is also one of the key factors that holds productivity down, as it slows feedback, increases errors, and makes change harder.  

## Why it matters  
The quality aspects we’ve discussed — **maintainability, extensibility, testability, readability, and reduced duplication** — all depend on how well complexity is managed. Without deliberate tactics, complexity accumulates, making the codebase harder to reason about and more error-prone.  

From an economic perspective, unmanaged complexity increases the cost of every change, slows down feature delivery, and reduces the organization’s ability to respond to new requirements. In contrast, well-managed complexity improves productivity, lowers risk, and creates the conditions for innovation by keeping the codebase adaptable and resilient.  

## Managing complexity as tactics for quality  
Rather than being an isolated concern, managing complexity provides the **engineering tactics** that help us achieve the broader quality aspects. Each technique below acts as a tool to tame complexity, creating systems that are reliable, adaptable, and easier to evolve.
