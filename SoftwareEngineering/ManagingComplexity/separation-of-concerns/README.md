# Separation of Concerns  

Separation of Concerns (SoC) is the principle of organizing a system so that each module, class, or component addresses a distinct aspect or responsibility. Each concern should be isolated, minimizing overlap and interaction with unrelated areas.  

SoC should be applied at multiple levels: within modules and classes, across system layers, and even at architectural and organizational levels. Using SoC in a broader context ensures that the software architecture, processes, and team responsibilities are aligned with clear boundaries.  

By separating concerns, software becomes easier to understand, modify, and evolve. SoC also drives cohesion and modularity by ensuring that each module focuses on a single, well-defined responsibility.  

## Why it matters  
- Improves readability: each component has a clear and specific role, making the system easier to understand.  
- Supports maintainability and extensibility: changes in one concern are less likely to impact others.  
- Enhances testability: isolated concerns are easier to test independently.  
- Reduces duplication: separating responsibilities encourages reuse of modules where appropriate.  
- Facilitates parallel development: teams can work on different concerns without interfering with one another.  

## Key drivers  
- **Clear boundaries**: define distinct responsibilities for each module or class.  
- **Encapsulation**: hide implementation details that are not relevant to other concerns.  
- **Explicit interfaces**: communicate only what is necessary between modules.  
- **Focused responsibilities**: avoid mixing unrelated concerns in the same module.  
- **Alignment with modularity and cohesion**: SoC ensures modules are both cohesive internally and loosely coupled externally.
