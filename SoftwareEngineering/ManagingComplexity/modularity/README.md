# Modularity  

Modularity is the degree to which a system’s components may be separated and recombined, often with the benefit of flexibility and variety in use. In practice, it means dividing a system into smaller, self-contained units (modules) that have clear boundaries and responsibilities. Each module encapsulates a specific part of the system’s functionality and communicates with others through well-defined interfaces.  

Modular components should be designed with the help of **separation of concerns** and serve a larger structure, ensuring that small parts contribute meaningfully to the overall system design.  

By structuring software into modules, engineers can isolate complexity, making each part easier to understand, test, and evolve independently.  

## Why it matters  
- Reduces cognitive load: developers only need to understand the module they are working on, not the entire system.  
- Supports maintainability and extensibility: modules can be changed, replaced, or extended with minimal impact on the rest of the system.  
- Facilitates testability: smaller, isolated modules are easier to test in isolation.  
- Encourages reuse: well-designed modules can often be applied in different contexts, reducing duplication.  

## Key drivers  
- **Clear boundaries**: each module should have a single, well-defined purpose.  
- **Explicit interfaces**: communication between modules should happen through stable, intentional contracts.  
- **Low coupling**: modules should minimize dependencies on one another.  
- **High cohesion**: related responsibilities should be grouped within the same module.  
- **Encapsulation**: internal details of a module should be hidden, exposing only what is necessary.
