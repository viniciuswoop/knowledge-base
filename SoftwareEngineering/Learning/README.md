# Optimizing for Learning

Software engineering is fundamentally a learning activity. We rarely begin with complete knowledge about the problem or the solution. Instead, engineers generate hypotheses, test them through working software, and adapt based on feedback.  

The goal is to create fast, high-quality feedback loops that accelerate this learning process. Each cycle of creating an assumption, implementation, and collecting feedback increases understanding of both the system being built and the domain it serves.  

**Why it matters:**  
- Learning reduces risk by uncovering unknowns early.  
- Fast learning cycles lower the cost of mistakes.  
- Engineering productivity increases as teams adapt more quickly to new requirements.

## Techniques to Optimize Learning

The following core techniques support and accelerate the learning process.

- [Working Iteratively](./WorkingIteratively/README.md)  
- [Feedback](./Feedback/README.md)  
- [Incrementalism](./Incrementalism/README.md)  
- [Empiricism](./Empiricism/README.md)  
- [Being Experimental](./Experimentalism/README.md)  


By adopting these techniques, engineers establish a disciplined approach to solving problems and continuously learning about the system and the business domain.
