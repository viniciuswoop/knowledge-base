# Working Iteratively

## What it is
Working iteratively means approaching software development in small, repeatable cycles rather than in large cycles with no clear direction, random approaches, and lack of methodology when approaching changes, which delays feedback. Each iteration is purposeful: it produces a clear outcome, fits within the overall design structure, and ensures that even small steps contribute meaningfully to the bigger picture.  

## Why it matters
- Reduces risk by exposing problems earlier.  
- Provides faster feedback, allowing teams to adjust direction quickly.  
- Keeps the team focused on delivering outcomes rather than just activities.  
- Ensures that small, validated changes accumulate into coherent progress aligned with system goals.  
- Encourages continuous improvement instead of deferring learning to the end.  

## Key drivers
- Short, repeatable development cycles that produce working software with a clear outcome.  
- Emphasis on outcomes that can be tested or evaluated against expectations.  
- Small iterations that are designed to fit and reinforce the overall system architecture.  
- Automated tests at each step to validate changes quickly and safely, ensuring that iterations remain reliable and do not compromise previous progress.  
- Acceptance that not all knowledge is available up front â€” iteration discovers it along the way.
