# Incrementalism

## What it is
Incrementalism is the practice of making progress through small, deliberate steps rather than large, all-at-once changes. Incremental design is directly related to modular application design, where components can be freely substituted or improved to ensure better performance. It is about building value progressively, taking advantage of modularity and componentized designs so that each change stands on its own while contributing to the broader system.  

## Why it matters
- Reduces risk by limiting the scope of each change — if something goes wrong, the impact is contained.  
- Makes progress visible and measurable, building confidence with stakeholders and the team.  
- Allows for faster feedback on smaller pieces of functionality.  
- Supports adaptability, since increments can be adjusted or redirected without discarding large amounts of work.  
- Builds resilience into the process, ensuring that the system remains stable while evolving.  

## Key drivers
- Breaking down large features or goals into smaller, deliverable steps.  
- Prioritizing increments that produce value or insight early.  
- Ensuring each increment is complete and testable on its own.  
- Using feedback from each increment to inform the next step.  
- Avoiding “big bang” changes that hide complexity until it is too late to address.
