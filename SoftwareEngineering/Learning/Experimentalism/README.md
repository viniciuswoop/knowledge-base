# Being Experimental

## What it is
Being experimental is the practice of intentionally testing ideas, designs, and approaches in controlled ways to discover what works best. In software engineering, it means treating changes as experiments: implementing them, observing their effects, and using evidence to guide further decisions. Experimentation allows teams to explore alternatives safely and learn from outcomes rather than relying solely on assumptions.  

Key aspects of effective experimentation include:  
- **Feedback**: Continuous feedback provides the information needed to evaluate the results of an experiment.  
- **Hypothesis**: Each experiment starts with a clear hypothesis that predicts an outcome.  
- **Measurement**: Observations must be measurable and reliable to validate or refute the hypothesis.  
- **Controlling the variables**: Limiting uncontrolled factors ensures that observed outcomes are truly caused by the change being tested.  

## Why it matters
- Encourages innovation by allowing safe exploration of new approaches.  
- Reduces the risk of large-scale failures by testing ideas incrementally.  
- Strengthens learning by converting hypotheses into observable results.  
- Supports adaptability, as teams can pivot or refine solutions based on experimental evidence.  
- Promotes a culture of inquiry, where assumptions are challenged and knowledge is continuously updated.  

## Key drivers
- Framing changes as hypotheses to be tested rather than fixed solutions.  
- Small, controlled experiments to validate ideas without jeopardizing system stability.  
- Using automated tests and monitoring to gather reliable feedback on experiments.  
- Reviewing and analyzing results to inform next steps and decision-making.  
- Iterating based on evidence, integrating successful experiments into the main system gradually.
