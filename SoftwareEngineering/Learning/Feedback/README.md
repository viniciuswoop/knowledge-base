# Feedback

## What it is
Feedback in software engineering is the process of obtaining timely, reliable information about the behavior, quality, and value of the system. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, feedback is *"the transmission of evaluative or corrective information about an action, event, or process to the original, or controlling, source."*  

Feedback allows us to establish a source of evidence for our decisions and begin to separate myth from reality. It transforms assumptions into knowledge by showing how the software actually performs in practice.  

Feedback can and should occur at multiple phases of engineering:  
- **Coding** – through automated tests, linters, and code reviews.  
- **Integration** – through continuous integration, system tests, and deployment pipelines.  
- **Design** – by validating design decisions against requirements and maintainability goals.  
- **Architecture** – by assessing trade-offs, scalability, and alignment with system qualities.  

## Why it matters
- Provides evidence to confirm or refute assumptions quickly.  
- Reduces the cost of mistakes by detecting defects early in the development cycle.  
- Enables faster learning, helping teams adapt designs and decisions with confidence.  
- Builds trust in the system, since engineers and stakeholders can see how changes impact outcomes.  
- Creates alignment between technical decisions and business needs by connecting changes to measurable results.  

## Key drivers
- Automated tests at different levels (unit, integration, system) to give fast technical feedback.  
- Continuous integration and delivery practices to ensure rapid validation of changes.  
- Monitoring and observability to provide feedback from the running system in production.  
- Code reviews and pair programming to exchange knowledge and spot issues early.  
- Direct user or stakeholder feedback loops to validate whether the software meets real needs.
