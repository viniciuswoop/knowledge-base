# Empiricism

## What it is
Empiricism is the practice of making decisions and forming conclusions based on evidence and observation rather than assumptions or intuition. In software engineering, it means validating ideas, designs, and implementations through experiments, tests, and real-world feedback. Empiricism ensures that knowledge about the system is grounded in reality and continuously updated as new information becomes available.  

## Why it matters
- Reduces the risk of costly mistakes by relying on actual evidence rather than speculation.  
- Accelerates learning by highlighting what works and what doesnâ€™t in practice.  
- Supports informed decision-making at all levels: design, coding, architecture, and operations.  
- Encourages a mindset of continuous improvement, where hypotheses are tested, refined, or discarded based on results.  
- Helps teams distinguish between assumptions, opinions, and verified knowledge.  

## Key drivers
- Automated tests, monitoring, and metrics to provide concrete evidence about system behavior.  
- Experimentation and prototyping to validate hypotheses before committing to large changes.  
- Observing user behavior and system performance to guide improvements.  
- Using feedback loops to continually refine designs, processes, and practices.  
- Documenting findings and lessons learned to ensure organizational knowledge grows over time.
