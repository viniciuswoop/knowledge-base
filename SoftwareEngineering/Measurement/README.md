# The Importance of Measurement

Engineering is not only about building systems, but also about measuring their outcomes. Without measurement, decisions are guided by assumption rather than evidence. Measurement connects software engineering back to its scientific foundation: form a hypothesis, run experiments, and evaluate results against data.

## What is Measurement?

Measurement in software engineering is the practice of using metrics to understand how a system and its development process perform. Good measurements give feedback, guide improvement, and help teams make informed trade-offs.  

## Why it Matters

- **Evidence over intuition**: metrics expose reality, even when it challenges assumptions.  
- **Guidance for improvement**: By tracking key indicators, teams can see the impact of practices and investments.  
- **Alignment with business goals**: well-chosen measurements connect engineering work to economic outcomes like speed, adaptability, and reliability.  

## Two Core Dimensions of Measurement

**Throughput**  
   - Represents how quickly value flows through the system.  
   - Examples include lead time for changes and deployment frequency.  
   - Higher throughput means the organization can deliver features and improvements faster.  

**Stability**  
   - Represents how reliably the system runs in production.  
   - Examples include change failure rate and mean time to restore (MTTR).  
   - Strong stability ensures that rapid changes do not compromise user trust or system reliability.  

Balancing throughput and stability is essential. Together, they reflect both the **speed** and **safety** of the software delivery process, and they provide a clear, measurable foundation for engineering improvement.
